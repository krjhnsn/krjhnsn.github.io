Hello! This blog is an experiment in creating a light-weight, simple site that can be used to share ideas and useful knowledge.

While thinking about starting this project, I anticipated that simple would be better and so I started looking for site infrastructure that would be convenient to manage, free to host, and nice to look at. After looking into a number of options, I found the winning combination: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I am using the [Tale Theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale), kindly developed and shared on Github by chesterhow.

And that's it! I hope someone will find something useful here and if that's the case, then it was all worth it! 

## Feedback

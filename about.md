This is a simple blog for sharing Python programming knowledge I've accumulated through experience (trial and error, really), colleagues that are far smarter and more talented than I, and many Stack Overflow searches. 

With each post, my goal is to share some syntax "nuts and bolts" but also some considerations, pitfalls, and practical applications. I make no claim to be 100% technically accurate or to follow best practices, I am simply sharing what has worked well for me! With any luck, one of these posts will shorten the learning curve for someone or spark an idea.

While thinking about starting this project, I wanted a site infrastructure that would be convenient to manage, free to host, and nice to look at. After looking into a number of options, I found the winning combination: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I am using the [Tale Theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale), kindly developed and shared on Github by chesterhow.

I hope you will find something useful here and if that's the case, then it was all worth it!

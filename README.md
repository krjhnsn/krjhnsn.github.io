# krjhnsn.blog

This is a simple blog for sharing Python programming knowledge I've accumulated through experience (trial and error, really), colleagues that are far smarter and more talented than I, and many Stack Overflow searches. 

With each post, my goal is to share some syntax "nuts and bolts" but also some considerations, pitfalls, and practical applications. I make no claim to be an expert or to follow pythonic best practices in my examples. I am simply sharing what has worked well for me and will do my best to provide code that is clear and readily applicable! With any luck, one of these posts will shorten the learning curve for someone or spark an idea.

Feel free to check out the published site [here](https://krjhnsn.github.io/).

This blog runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is based on the [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme, kindly shared by chesterhow.

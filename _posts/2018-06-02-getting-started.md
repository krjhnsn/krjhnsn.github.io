Well, here it is. The first post. It's in the wild--running like a unicorn with a sloth on it's back. 

"Hold up, is this a corner of the internet I don't want to be in? Should I back away slowly?" you may be asking yourself. This blog is an experiemnt. I am writing it to share information that I've found useful and to learn a few things myself. I hope that someone may find a piece of it useful.

First, I'll focus on things I've learned using Python for data analysis. More posts to come.

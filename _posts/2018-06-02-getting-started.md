Well, here it is. The first post. It's in the wild; running like a unicorn with a sloth on it's back. 

You may be asking yourself "hold up, is this a corner of the internet I don't want to be in? Should I back away slowly?" Don't worry, this blog won't bite. I am writing it to share information that I've found useful and to learn a few things myself. Take a look for yourself and see if anything catches your eye.

First, I'll focus on things I've learned using Python for data analysis. More posts to come.

Let's go...
